    <main>
      <p>I graduated from the University of Wisconsin-Madison with a B.S. in Mechanical Engineering. 
      I work at Epic, a healtcare software company, which has grown my interest in programming and allowed me to practice writing code. 
      I'm self-taught in HTML/CSS/JavaScript and also have some exposure to other programming languages
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>I'm looking to continue learning and practicing various programming languages.
